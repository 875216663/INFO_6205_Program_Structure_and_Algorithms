Implementing Ford-Fulkerson in Python requires defining the graph, capacity matrix, residual graph, and conducting DFS to find augmenting paths. Here's a simplified version of the code:

def ford_fulkerson(graph, source, sink):
    flow = [[0] * len(graph) for _ in range(len(graph))]
    residual_graph = [list(row) for row in graph]  # Initialize residual graph

    while True:
        path = dfs(residual_graph, source, sink)
        if not path:
            break
        
        min_capacity = min(residual_graph[u][v] for u, v in path)
        for u, v in path:
            flow[u][v] += min_capacity
            flow[v][u] -= min_capacity
            residual_graph[u][v] -= min_capacity
            residual_graph[v][u] += min_capacity

    return flow

# Example usage
graph = [[0, 10, 10, 0],
         [0, 0, 2, 4],
         [0, 0, 0, 10],
         [0, 0, 0, 0]]

source = 0
sink = 3
max_flow = ford_fulkerson(graph, source, sink)
print("Max flow:", max_flow[source][sink])
