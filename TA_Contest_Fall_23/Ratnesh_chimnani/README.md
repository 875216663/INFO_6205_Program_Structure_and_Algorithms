For Simplicity all the content, code and quiz has been uploaded in the 2 PDF files, including real life examples. A lot of effort has been put to make lessons fun by including games such as Tic Tac Toe and Chess as NP and NP Hard problems. Do check it out :)

Folders:
Lesson 1 - P, NP and NP Hard
Lesson 2 - Graphs
