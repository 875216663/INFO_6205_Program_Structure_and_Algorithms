# INFO 6205 Program Structure and Algorithms

## Course Prerequisites

- A knowledge of python or some other programming language. All course examples will be in python.

## Course Description

Presents data structures and related algorithms, beginning with a brief review of dynamic memory allocation. Discusses the fundamental data structures in detail, including the abstract representation of algorithms, and implementation methods. Focuses on understanding the application of the abstract data structure and the circumstances that affect implementation decisions. Covers lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and graphs. Covers recursion and searching and sorting algorithms in detail.
Emphasizes data abstraction and encapsulation in code design. Explores external storage structures, time permitting.

This is an introductory course in algorithms. The focus of this course is on learning algorithm design techniques for solving computational problems.

This course teaches techniques for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms, emphasizing methods useful in practice. Topics covered include sorting, search trees, heaps, hashing, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, amortized analysis, graph algorithms, shortest paths, network flow, randomized algorithms, data structures, approximation algorithms, and graph search.

We will cover theory as well as implement, simulate, and visualize algorithms using python. There will be weekly homework assignments, two in-class midterm exams, a final exam, and a research project.
