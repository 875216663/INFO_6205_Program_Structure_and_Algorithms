    "### Question 1 (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "At Northeastern University, there are x research groups, each specializing in one research field such as HCI, Data Analytics, Bioinformatics, etc. Each research group has a limited number of positions y and a fixed grant amount for funding research and stipends. Your task is to match n graduate students with these research groups based on specific conditions.\n",
    "Both the students and research groups have preferences: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Students prioritize based on the research focus, potential for publication, and mentorship quality.\n",
    "- Research groups prioritize based on students' skills, past research, academic records, and specific skill sets they bring \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "1. Fills all available research positions in each group.\n",
    "2. Does not exceed the grant amount allocated to any research group.\n",
    "3. Match based on the students' and groups' preferences and skill sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- x represents the Number of research groups.\n",
    "- n represents the Number of graduate students.\n",
    "- Each research group has a limited number of available positions y, where y>0.\n",
    "- Each student has a non-empty set of skills.\n",
    "- Each research group may require one or more skills to be considered for a position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Input and Output Format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*-Input:* Lists representing students, their preferences, stipend demands, and skill sets, followed by lists for research groups, their preferences, grant amounts, and required skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "*-Output:* A stable list of matches between students and research groups that adheres to the grant and skill set constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derive an algorithm to create stable matching between the students and research groups. Devise a pseudocode and explain the time complexity of your algorithm.\n"

    "### **Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is an extension of the Stable Marriage problem, and we can apply a modified Gale-Shapley algorithm to solve it. The modification includes checking for grant amount constraints and ensuring that students have the required skills for a given research group.\n",

    "                Mark student as \"matched\"\n",
    "                Decrease group's remaining grant by student's stipend demand\n",
    "                if group's positions are filled:\n",

    "                if group prefers student over worst_matched_student:\n",
    "                    Remove worst_matched_student from group\n",
    "                    Add student to group\n",

    "                    Mark student as \"matched\"\n",

    "### Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each student may need to propose to each of the x research groups: *O(n * x) = O(n * x)*\n",
    "2. In each proposal, we may need to check if a student has the required skills for the group. This check can take up to *O(5)* time: *O(5) = O(1)*\n",
    "3. Also, for each proposal, we may need to check the worst-matched student in a research group, which can take *O(y)*, where y is the number of positions in the group: *O(y) = O(y)*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, overall, the time complexity becomes *O(n * x * 1 * y)* = *O(n * x * y)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: x is the number of research groups, n is the number of students, and y is the maximum number of positions in any group."
