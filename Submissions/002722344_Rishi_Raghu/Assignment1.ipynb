    "### **Justification and Proof of Correctness - Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, proving an algorithm's correctness usually involves showing that it meets certain properties or conditions that define a \"correct\" solution. For the modified Gale-Shapley algorithm, we are interested in proving two key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stability**: No student and research group should have an incentive to break their assigned matching to pair with each other.\n",
    "- **Feasibility**: All constraints like the skills, stipend demands, and grant amounts should be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "For Students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A student will propose to research groups in decreasing order of preference.\n",
    "- A student will never be removed from a more preferred group to be added to a less preferred group.\n",
    "- Therefore, once matched, a student has no incentive to deviate from the assigned group, as they are in the best available position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Research Groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A group will only replace a current match if it prefers the new student.\n",
    "- Once a group is full, any replacement maintains or improves its preference list.\n",
    "- Therefore, a research group has no reason to break the current matching for a different student who is less preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- The skill sets are checked before making any match. Therefore, no student is in a group without having the required skills.\n",
    "- The stipend is checked before matching and is deducted from the group's grant, ensuring that the group can afford all its matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inductive Proof for Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base Case: When the algorithm starts, no one is matched, which is a valid (if incomplete) state of the system.\n",
    "- Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that after k iterations, all students and groups are matched stably and feasibly.\n",
    "- Inductive Step: Consider iteration k+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If a student is matched, they go to the most preferred group that has not yet rejected them and for which they have the required skills and can be afforded by the group's remaining grant. This maintains stability and feasibility.\n",
    "    - If a group becomes full or needs to replace a less preferred student, it does so with a more preferred one, again maintaining stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these steps, you can argue that your modified Gale-Shapley algorithm is both stable and feasible, thus proving its correctness."
