    "### **Justification and Proof of Correctness - Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving the correctness of an algorithm generally involves demonstrating that it fulfills specific qualities or requirements that identify a \"correct\" answer. We want to prove two key features of the improved Gale-Shapley algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stability**: There should be no motivation for any student or research group to break their allocated matching to pair with each other.\n",
    "- **Feasibility**: All limitations, such as skills, stipend expectations, and grant amounts, must be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "For Students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A student will submit study groups in their preferred sequence. \n",
    "- A student will never be transferred from a higher favored group to a less preferred group. \n",
    "- As a result, once matched, a student has little reason to depart from the designated group because they are in the greatest possible position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Research Groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A group will only replace a current match if the new student is preferred. When a group is full, any replacement keeps or enhances the group's preference list.\n",
    "- As a result, a research group has no incentive to break the existing matching for a different, less desirable student.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before making any matches, the skill sets are verified. As a result, no student is in a group who does not possess the necessary abilities. Before matching, the stipend is reviewed and taken from the group's funding, guaranteeing that the group can afford all of its matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inductive Proof of Correctess \n",
    "\n",
    "- Base Case (n=0): No one is matched when the process starts, which is a valid condition of the system. Thus it holds for n=0.\n",
    "- Inductive Hypothesis(n=k): Assuming that the procedure holds for n=k, all students and groups are stably and feasibly matched after k iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inductive Step(n=k+1): Consider iteration k+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If a student is matched, they are assigned to the most favored group that has not yet rejected them, for which they have the necessary abilities and may be supported by the group's remaining grant. \n",
    "    - If a group gets full or has to replace a less favored student, it replaces him or her with a more preferred one, ensuring stability.\n",
    "   - This also indicates that if the group discovered the most preferred student in the k+1 iteration, the less preferred student would have been replaced in the k iteration. As a result, the procedure works for n=k+1.\n",

    "Emergency Evacuation Plan in a Building Using Graph Traversal Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a building with multiple floors and rooms, represented as a graph where each node is a room and each edge represents a doorway between two rooms. Some rooms have staircases that lead to other floors. Due to a fire emergency, the occupants of the building need to be evacuated as quickly and safely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a pseudocode for a modified BFS or DFS algorithm to find the quickest path from any given room to the nearest emergency exit. The algorithm should account for various constraints like blocked doorways, room capacities, and other hazards. The goal is to evacuate everyone to safety while minimizing the total evacuation time.\n",

    "- Describe the problem-solving approach you plan to use before diving into the pseudocode.\n",

    "- Number of Rooms: An integer N indicating the number of rooms (nodes).\n",
    "- Number of Doorways: An integer M indicating the number of doorways (edges).\n",
    "- Edge Weights: A list of M tuples (a, b, w), indicating there is a doorway between room a and room b with a time-weight of w (to- cross).\n",
    "- Emergency Exits: A list E of rooms that are designated as emergency exits.\n",

    "### **Justification and Proof of Correctness - Question 8**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode Justification and correctness proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization Step\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initializing the distance of all rooms to infinity except for the start room, which is set to zero This approach makes sure that any actual path found later will be shorter than infinity and will replace the initialized value, making it a minimal value at that point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - At the start, distance[start_room] = 0 and distance[any_other_room] = ∞. This ensures that the algorithm will correctly identify if it is able to improve upon this initial assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Priority Queue (Q)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Priority queues ensure that we always choose the room closest to the starting room at every step. This is crucial for optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Whenever we pop an element from the priority queue, it's guaranteed to be the room with the smallest distance label. This property ensures that we are exploring nodes in an order that aligns with finding the shortest paths first, validating the use of a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Emergency Exit Check\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Finding the shortest path to the nearest emergency exit; As soon as we find one, we can safely terminate the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The priority queue ensures that the first exit encountered has the shortest path, and no other path to any other exit could be shorter. Therefore, stopping the algorithm when an emergency exit is reached is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Impassable Rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The algorithm checks for impassable rooms and avoids them, which is necessary for the safety of the evacuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The algorithm only marks a room as visited if it is not in the impassable rooms list. This ensures that impassable rooms never affect the outcome of the evacuation plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Edge Relaxation and Update\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When a room is visited, the algorithm updates the distances to its neighbors, ensuring that the shortest path is updated iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By updating only when a shorter path is found (new_distance < distance[neighbor]), the algorithm ensures optimality. This ensures that the shortest path to each room is found by the time that room is removed from the priority queue."
