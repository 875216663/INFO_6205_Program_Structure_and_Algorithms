    "\n",
    "The Gale-Shapley algorithm, also known as the Deferred Acceptance algorithm, provides a systematic way to solve the hospital resident matching problem. Here is how the algorithm works:\n",

    "Initialization: Start with all medical students and hospitals being unmatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration: Repeat the following steps until no further changes occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unmatched student proposes to their most preferred hospital. Students make their proposals based on their own preference order.\n",

    "Termination: The algorithm terminates when no more proposals can be made or accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: The final matching is considered stable because no student-hospital pair would both prefer each other to their assigned match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of Stability:\n",
    "The Gale-Shapley algorithm guarantees a stable matching. To prove this, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is an unstable pair (S, H) where S is a student and H is a hospital who both prefer each other to their current assignments. This means that either S proposed to H before and was rejected or H tentatively accepted S at some point but later replaced S with another student they preferred more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, if S proposed to H before, it implies that H either never preferred S more than their current resident or they changed their preference during the algorithm. But since the algorithm only accepts a new student if they are strictly more preferred, this is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, if H tentatively accepted S but later replaced them, it means H found a student they preferred more than S. However, this also cannot occur since the algorithm always selects the most preferred students for hospitals.\n",

    "Therefore, there cannot be any unstable pairs in the final matching, and it is a stable solution.\n",

    "**Reflection Quality:** Through this problem, we used mathematical induction to prove the correctness of the cross-over value for two algorithms with different runtime functions. We showed that for small values of n, one algorithm is faster, and as n grows, the other algorithm becomes faster, defining a cross-over point where their relative efficiency changes. This demonstrates the concept of comparing algorithm performance and identifying a threshold value for their respective advantages.\n",

    "**Proof of Correctness:** \n",
    "Termination: The algorithm will terminate because BFS explores nodes level by level, and it stops once it reaches user2, which is guaranteed to happen if there's a path between user1 and user2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Base Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "If user1 and user2 are the same, the function returns [user1], which is correct since the shortest path from a node to itself is just that node.\n",
    "If there's no connection between user1 and user2, the BFS will not find user2, and it will return False, which is also correct.\n",
    "Path Construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a path is found (i.e., current_user becomes user2), the algorithm correctly reconstructs the path by backtracking from user2 to user1 using the parent dictionary. This ensures that the returned path is the shortest.\n",
    "Completeness:\n",
    "\n",
    "The BFS algorithm ensures that if there is a path between user1 and user2, it will be found. This is because BFS explores all reachable nodes from user1, guaranteeing that it will reach user2 if a path exists.\n",
    "Handling Cycles:\n",
    "\n",
    "The visited set prevents revisiting nodes that have already been explored, thus avoiding infinite loops in the presence of cycles.\n",
    "In summary, the algorithm correctly identifies whether there is a path between user1 and user2 in the social network graph. If a path exists, it returns the shortest path. The termination conditions and base cases are handled correctly, and the path construction ensures that the returned path is indeed the shortest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm's correctness is supported by the properties and guarantees of Breadth-First Search when applied to graph traversal.\n",

    "**Reflection Quality:**\n",
    "Through this problem, we've learned the following key concepts and insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Representation: The problem involves representing a social network as a graph, where users are nodes, and connections are edges. This allows us to model real-world relationships in a computational context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS is a powerful graph traversal algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph. It explores nodes level by level, guaranteeing that the first path found is the shortest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path Reconstruction: To return the shortest path, we use a parent dictionary to backtrack from the destination node to the source node once the path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Special Cases: Special cases, such as when the source and destination nodes are the same or when there is no connection between them, need to be handled explicitly to ensure correct behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completeness and Termination: Understanding that BFS guarantees completeness (finding a path if it exists) and that it terminates when it reaches the destination node or exhausts all possibilities is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness Proof: It's crucial to provide a rigorous correctness proof for the algorithm, showing that it correctly identifies the presence of a path and returns the shortest path when it exists.\n",
