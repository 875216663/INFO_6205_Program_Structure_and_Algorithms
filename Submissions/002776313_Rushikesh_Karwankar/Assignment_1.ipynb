    "\n",
    "The Gale-Shapley algorithm, also known as the Deferred Acceptance algorithm, provides a systematic way to solve the hospital resident matching problem. Here is how the algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: Start with all medical students and hospitals being unmatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration: Repeat the following steps until no further changes occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unmatched student proposes to their most preferred hospital. Students make their proposals based on their own preference order.\n",
    "Each hospital receives proposals and tentatively accepts the most preferred students, up to their capacity. If a hospital is already filled to capacity, it accepts the proposing student only if they are more preferred than its least preferred current resident.\n",
    "Rejected students remain unmatched and will propose to their next most preferred hospital in the next iteration.\n",
    "Termination: The algorithm terminates when no more proposals can be made or accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: The final matching is considered stable because no student-hospital pair would both prefer each other to their assigned match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of Stability:\n",
    "The Gale-Shapley algorithm guarantees a stable matching. To prove this, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is an unstable pair (S, H) where S is a student and H is a hospital who both prefer each other to their current assignments. This means that either S proposed to H before and was rejected or H tentatively accepted S at some point but later replaced S with another student they preferred more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, if S proposed to H before, it implies that H either never preferred S more than their current resident or they changed their preference during the algorithm. But since the algorithm only accepts a new student if they are strictly more preferred, this is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, if H tentatively accepted S but later replaced them, it means H found a student they preferred more than S. However, this also cannot occur since the algorithm always selects the most preferred students for hospitals.\n",

    "Therefore, there cannot be any unstable pairs in the final matching, and it is a stable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gale-Shapley algorithm also ensures that the resulting matching is efficient and respects the preferences of both students and hospitals.
