When I use ChatGPT, it tends to be pretty reliable. But there are times when it makes some low-level mistakes. For example, it says that 0.8^n is an exponential level of time complexity, and therefore a very rapid growth. In reality this time complexity is O(1) level. We need to pay attention to the details of his answers and not give up thinking when using ChatGPT.
After doing this assignment, I have a better understanding of stable matching and time complexity. And I have also thought about the various situations of stable matching and know how the stable matching algorithm changes in different situations.
