    "Statement 1: f(n)=O(f(n+1))<br>\n",
    "False<br>\n",
    "This statement is saying that the function f(n) grows at the same rate or slower than the function f(n+1). This is not always true. For example, the function 2^n grows faster than the function 2^(n+1), so 2^n is not O(2^(n+1)).<br><br>\n",

    "True<br>\n",
    "This statement is saying that the function f(n) grows at the same rate or slower than the function f(2n). This is always true. This is because f(2n) is just a scaled version of f(n). For example, if f(n) = n, then f(2n) = 2n. So, f(n) is O(f(2n)).<br>\n",
    "To prove this statement true, we need to show that for any function f(n) that is big-O of g(n), it is also big-O of g(2n). Let's assume that f(n) is O(g(n)).<br>\n",
    "According to the definition of big-O notation, there exist constants C and n0 such that for all n ≥ n0, f(n) ≤ C * g(n).<br>\n",
    "Now, consider f(2n). We want to show that f(2n) is also bounded by a constant multiple of g(2n). Using the definition of big-O, we need to find new constants C' and n0' such that for all n ≥ n0', f(2n) ≤ C' * g(2n).<br>\n",

    "Now, we can manipulate the inequality:<br>\n",

    "However, in this case, it's not possible to find such constants. Let's assume by contradiction that we can find C and n0. Then we have:<br>\n",
    "n ≤ C * (n+1)<br>\n",

    "n / (n+1) ≤ C<br>\n",
    "As n approaches infinity, the left-hand side approaches 1, while C remains a constant. This is a contradiction because there's no constant C that can bound 1 as n becomes arbitrarily large.<br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, the first roommate remains in their current room.<br>\n",

    "Step 3: Result<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once every roommate is assigned, you'll have a stable roommate assignment.<br><br>\n",

    "The model of roommate assignments is designed to avoid conflicts and preferences, so it requires careful consideration of each roommate's preferences.<br>\n",
